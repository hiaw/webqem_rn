- Encountered [iOS App Transport Security Issue](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.28/docs/known-issues.html#ios-app-transport-security-and-loading-http-resources), that's why it took much longer to complete project.
- react-native-chart does not allow to different color for each bar of the bar chart, may be able to another library if different color is a fixed requirement.
